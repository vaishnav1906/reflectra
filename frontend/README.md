Reflectra 🧠✨

A Personalized AI Companion for Reflection, Insight, and Growth

Reflectra is an intelligent, user-centric AI system designed to learn from user interactions, model individual personality traits, and provide reflective, adaptive, and meaningful responses over time.

Unlike traditional chatbots, Reflectra focuses on long-term understanding, self-reflection, and context-aware interaction, acting as a cognitive companion rather than a simple question–answer system.
